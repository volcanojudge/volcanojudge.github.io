      <h2>Why is Volcano Judge's code mostly open-source?</h2>
      <p>Excellent question! The whole point of Volcano Judge is to learn and enhance your understanding about programming concepts/algorithms. We extended this idea when making some of the code publicly-viewable.
</p><p>Making the judging system may have been difficult and time-consuming, but it was also very rewarding, and taught the author a lot about how online judges work. In an effort to make the process seamless for others,
we released a public version of the Volcano Judge code (this is <i>literally</i> just an old version of the judge with some tweaks).</p><p>We don't intend to improve the publicly-viewable system, and you are not allowed to use the code, run the
software online, or publish the code elsewhere. You can't do anything except for reading it and learning from it. It's there for educational purposes so that you can learn how to make your own judge, or just to understand how things work!</p>
<p>The repo containing the code can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/volcanojudge/online-judge">here</a>. Be sure to follow @VolcanoJudge everywhere and sign up on the <a target="_blank" href="https://volcanojudge.pythonanywhere.com">Volcano Judge website</a>.</p>
